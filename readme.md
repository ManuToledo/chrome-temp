# About

chrome-temp is a series of scripts that allow you to create a Google Chrome profile template with all your needs (bookmarks, themes, passwords...) and launch (virtually) infinite Google Chrome instances that are independent from eachother, each one with a temporary copy of that profile.

# How-to

First you need to create a new Google Chrome profile using the *new-profile.bat* script.

Then you can launch *chrome-temp.vbs* everytime you need a fresh and independent Google Chrome instance.

You can use the *new-profile.bat* script to delete the old profile and make a new one, or use the *edit-profile.bat* script to modify the current profile.
